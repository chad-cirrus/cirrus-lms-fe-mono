Your instructor will take a passenger-like role, such that you should only expect mistakes that jeopardize the flight\'s safety to be corrected. Factors like managing distractions, maintaining situational awareness, and avoiding task saturation play essential roles in the overall outcome of this lesson.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou are required to act as pilot-in-command safely and without assistance from your instructor. Tasks are complete when youâ€™re able to execute them within the completion standards without the assistance of your instructor.
